# How to play

The game is played with a standard 52 deck of playing cards and is for 2 - 5 players. A standard game with 2 players takes approximately half an hour.

## Aim of the game

The aim of each round is to be the first to play all your cards. When a player wins a round, they start the next round with one more card in their hand. Every player starts round one with five cards in their hand, so whoever wins that round will start with six cards in round two. The player that wins a round when starting with ten cards wins the game. Hence, the shortest a game can be is 6 rounds, with the same player winning each successive round.

## Gameplay

At the start of a round, each player is dealt 5 + however-many-rounds-they've-won cards. Players look at their cards, and the top card of the remaining deck is placed face up. The deck is left in the middle, and the face up card is the start of the discard pile. The first player to act is the one with the fewest cards in their hand, if it's a tie the youngest goes first. Play starts off clockwise.

The first player to act can place any card on top of the first face up card, known as the discard pile. The next player to act can either play a card or pick up a card from the remaining deck. The player can pick up from the deck even if they could have played a card from their hand.

Whether a card can be played depends on the previous two cards. If the top card is _higher_ than the previous, the next card must be _lower_ than (or the same value as) the top card. If the top card is _lower_ than the previous, the next card must be higher than (or the same value as) the top card. This higher-lower-higher-lower pattern is why the game is called lo-hi.

Henceforth in this document, "higher than" really means "higher than or equal to" and similarly "lower than" means "lower than or equal to".

### Doubles, Triples, and Quadruples

If a card is played on top of a card the same value, the player decides whether the next player must play higher or lower. The exception to this rule is for Aces and Twos, where the next player can play any card (as it is impossible to play higher/lower than an Ace/two, respectively).

If a card is the third of the same value, the player playing the third card states the exact value of the card to be played.

If a card is the fourth of the same value, the player playing the fourth card says "lo-hi!" and can play again.

A player can play multiple cards at once. For example, if a King was the previous card and the player who's turn it was had two kings, they could play both at once and have therefore played a triple.

### Runs

Consecutive cards of length at least 3 can be played at once, as a run. This reverses the order of play. The player playing the run must order the run following whether they are supposed to be playing higher or lower, for example if the previous two cards are an 8 followed by a Jack, the run 4,5,6 must be played in the order 6 then 5 then 4. After this run is played, the next player must play higher than a 4, as the 4 is lower than the previous card: a 5.

### Pick up Pick up Pick up

If for three consecutive moves players pick up, which would be either because they couldn't play any card or chose not to, the top card from the deck is turned over and becomes the top of the discard pile. Whether the next player plays higher or lower is the same as what was for the previous card. Say, for example, three consecutive pick ups happened because a Queen was down with HIGHER and nobody played a Queen, King or Ace. The card from the top of the deck comes with HIGHER attached, meaning the next card played must be higher. Note this applies even if the card was a King, and would likely result in three more pick ups (because if people couldn't play higher than a queen they likely can't play higher than a King).

### End of the deck

If the end of the deck is reached, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the deck, with the top card from the discard pile still being the next to play on with all rules attached.

### Quick-fire Rules to remember

* Suits do not matter
* Aces are high
* Double: player chooses higher/lower
* Triple: player chooses exact value
* Quadruple: player states "lo-hi" and plays again (any card)
* Runs have to be of at least length 3, and are played in increasing/decreasing order if playing higher/lower, respectively.
* A run reverses the order of play (irrelevant when only two players)
* After 3 consecutive pick ups, a card is turned over from the top of the deck onto the discard pile. Whether the next player plays higher/lower is the same higher/lower as for the previous card.

## Example Round

Suppose Alice, Balice, and Calice are in the middle of playing a game of lo-hi. For simplicity, we shall refer to them by their first initials. A won the first round, B won the second and third round, and C has yet to win a round.

###Set up

So, at the start of round four, A is dealt 6 cards, B is dealt 7 cards, and C is dealt 5 cards.

A hand: 6 :hearts:, 8 :clubs:, 9 :clubs:, 10 :spades:, Jack :hearts:, King :diamonds:
B hand: 2 :clubs:, 10 :diamonds:, King :hearts:, King :spades:, King :clubs:, Ace :hearts:, Ace :clubs:
C hand: 3 :clubs:, 4 :hearts:, 9 :hearts:, Queen :hearts:, Queen :diamonds:

First face up card: 7 :hearts:

As suits are not important, from now on cards will not be referred to with suits attached.

### Game play

* C is first to act, as they have the fewest cards (5) in their hand, which is a direct result of not having won any of the previous rounds. C can play any card, so plays their 9.

* B is sitting to the left of C, so goes next. They have to play lower than a 9, as 9 is higher than 7. The only card that B can play is their 2, alternatively B can choose to pick up the top card from the deck. B elects to play their 2.

* A now has to play higher than a 2, which means they can play any card. They elect to play the run 8,9,10,Jack. It is important that the run is in that order, as they are playing higher.

* B plays next, as the playing order is reversed by the run. B has to play lower than a Jack, as a Jack is higher than a 10. B chooses to play the their three Kings (a triple), and states that the next card must be an Ace.

* C picks up, as they have no Ace. They pick up a 2.

* A picks up, as they have no Ace. They pick up an Ace. They cannot play this Ace, as their turn was used picking up.

* B plays their two Aces. As this is a double they can state higher or lower, but it is irrelevant as the next card must be lower than an Ace.

The current state of the round is as follows:
A hand: 6, King, Ace
B hand: 10
C hand: 2,3,4,Queen,Queen

Top face up card: Ace
Second face up card: Ace

It is C's turn to act.

* C plays their two Queen's and states "higher"

* A elects to pick up, even though they could play their King or Ace. This is because they know it is B's turn to act next, and they know B could win the round with their next turn. Whilst they don't know what B's card is, they know it is unlikely to be higher than a Queen. If A did play their King, any card B has except an A would be playable, meaning B would win the round. A picks up a Jack.

* B picks up, as their 10 cannot be played higher than a Queen. The card they pick up is another 10.

* C picks up, as they cannot play any card higher than a Queen.

* As there have now been three pick-ups in a row, the top card from the deck is placed face up on the discard pile. It is a 7.

* Whilst 7 is lower than a Queen, the next player must play higher than a 7 as they were previously having to play higher than a Queen. They are not playing higher because a 7 is lower than a Queen. It is A's turn, and they plays their J

* B plays their two 10s, and has won the round as they have no cards left.

This means next round A would be dealt 6 cards, B 8 cards, and C 5 cards.
